<br/>
	<p>Augmented Reality relates to a field in which hardware components are manipulated to produce an illusion in which the physical world is interconnected to a virtual reality. Unlike virtual reality, augmented reality is comprised of both real and artificial elements.</p> 
	<p>This field is widely used in military projects, advanced technology, and gaming purposes. For example, the military is developing bionic contact lenses to create wireless communication with no physical traces. This will improve efficiency between networking and transferring information more quickly.</p> 
	<p>These types of programs are written in special 3D languages to ensure that the physical world is integrated with the electronic world. Augmented reality is the key to connecting our modern world with a more readily accessible future. One of the most widespread use of Augmented Reality within our daily live is the use of smart phones. For example, a bar code reader app on a phone can be an example of Augmented Reality because the program is created in such a way that the camera can take a picture of the physical world and come come up with specific information. </p> 
	<p>Large companies such as Google sell smart glasses which help read information on quite ordinary objects. These Google Glasses provide an interface on the digital lens and responds to voice commands by the user. Google continues to take this project and improve upon it in an attempt to provide digital eyesight to the blind. By integrating augmented reality into daily lives, companies such as Google can strive to use technology to address modern issues.</p>
